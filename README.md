## Big-O Guide

Calculation not dependent on input size - O(1)

1. single - O(1) [constant]
2. loop - O(n) [linear]
3. nested loops - O(n^2)
4. input size is reduced by half - O(logn)

## Space complexity

O(1) - Constant
O(n) - Linear
O(logn) - Logrithmic

## Algorithm design techniques

### Here's a list of algorithms

#### Brute force

Simple and exhaustive technique that evalutes every possible outcome to find the best solution. Eg: Linear search.

#### Greedy

Choose the best option at the time, without any consideration for the further. Eg. Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.

#### Divide and Conquer

Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solution is recombined to determine the overall solution. Eg: Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Tower of Hanoi.

#### Dynamic Promming

Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub-problems. Store the result and reuse it for the same sub-problems. This is called memoisation and is an optimisation technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm. Eg: Fibonacci numbers and climbing staircase.

#### Backtracking

Generate all possible solutions. Check if solution satisfies all the given constraints and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions. If the constrains are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution. Eg: N-Queens problem.
